The amazing LEGO Minifig Rig was created by Graeme "Littlebrick" Allen from his thread here: http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/14737/the-minifig-rig-v12-is-up/

Also a big thanks to Ninth from the Panda3D forums for his strategy camera script. It helped a lot when trying to work out the mathsy camera stuff

Eric Marchesin's A-Star pathfinding example was a great help http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4391/C-A-Star-is-born

Movement of units based on Martin Schultz from here http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/c-c-style-rts-community-project-generals.17634/
